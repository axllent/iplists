# IP Lists

A personal curated list of IP and CIDR addresses belonging to various networks (good and bad!) for use in a WAF and/or firewall.

The lists are sourced from various places (see [generate_ip_lists.yml](.github/workflows/generate_iplists.yml)).

Although public and open source, this the IP lists in this repository is not intended for public use as they are subject to change at any time (I will rename, remove or add lists as I need).
If you want modifications then you can fork and maintain your own version :)
