# IP Lists

This repository contains a curated collection of IP and CIDR addresses associated with various networks (both beneficial and malicious) for use in WAFs and/or firewalls.

The lists are compiled from multiple sources (refer to [generate-iplists.yml](.github/workflows/generate-iplists.yml)) and are optimized by aggregating entries into CIDR blocks wherever possible, significantly reducing the total number of entries.

While this repository is public and open source, the lists are intended for personal use and may change at any time (lists may be renamed, removed, or added as needed). If you wish to use it then feel free to fork the repository and and maintain your own version.
